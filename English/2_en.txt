Designs for Hope and Change

most modern designers focus on making cool products that people want to buy

they add beauty and convenience to our life -lives by designing nice clothes, fancy cars and other things

sadly, people in developing countries can't afford these things

they struggle to fill their basic needs

thankfully, there are some designers who work to make products to help them

the following designs aim to improve people's life in developing countries


Turning empty can to a radio

VP was a designer who worked for U and UN

he noticed that a lot of people in developing countries are illiteral

they can't read megazines and news

to make matters worse, they had little electricity available where they lived, and they can't afford batteries for radio

they were cut off from the society without knowing a news about what is happening on the outside world

In 1962, however, P made a radio made of old cans that doesn't need batteries

It can be powered by things like burning wax or cow dung which can be easily found around the village

The heat from the fire comes up and makes enough energy to power the small earplug speaker

even better, the design is so simple that nearly anyone could make their own for less than nine cents

as a result, P's tin can radio was used for several years to deliver important news and information to poor peoples in I and I


clean water in a rolling barrel

clean water is necessary for our health

but it isn't commom in some parts on the world

people who can't get enough clean water could be exposed to many health threats

in 2009, for example, UN announced that about thousand people who live in Z, died from collera, which is a disease from drinking not clean water

to avoid getting the disease, people in many parts of africa need to walk long distance to get clean water

after filling their basket with water, they get back home with on their head

this caused not only pain and health problems

HR was invented to solve these problems

it is made of big plastic barrel and a long handle

the barrel can hold up to 90 kilograms of water and people just need to roll the barrel back home

they can carry large amount of clean water with less effort

making those poor people in africa get clean water easily, HR saved countless lives


ball made for inspire hope

in many countries soccer has been the most famous sport

however, kids in poor countries can't afford proper equipment

they often use empty can as a ball

this make their bare feet hurt

so a korean design team made DBP

that provides a special soccer ball to kids in disaster areas which is made from aid boxes

boxes are sent to poor people to give basic supplies

when the box is empty, kids can easily turn it to a soccer ball following the instructions printed on the box

kids not only do safe and fun activities, but also have a ball that inspire their dreams

DBP is an example of how a good design can efficently improve poor people's lives


See better to learn better

eyesight problems cause difficulty on learning by making it harder to read writings on board or textbooks

in mexico, its expected that up to 70% of students needs glasses

however, many poor families can't buy glasses for their child

in addition, bad eyesight is considered a handicap in mexico

therefore, many students refused to wear glasses

to help fight this problem, a design team made special glasses which appeals to young students

this glasses are made of special frames which is divided in two

wearer can choose different top and bottom color for their own look

this makes students fun to wear glasses without feeling ashamed

and they can get a nice pair of glasses for free

thanks for this project, students can see more clearer, learn better and have more chances of success later in their lifes
